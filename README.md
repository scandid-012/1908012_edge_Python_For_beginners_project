Advanced Soybean Agricultural Dataset

The "Advanced Soybean Agricultural Dataset" is a meticulously curated dataset designed to support agricultural research and machine learning applications. This dataset was compiled in 2025 as part of a collaborative research effort at the College of Agriculture, University of Tikrit. The dataset has been developed under the supervision of:

Assistant Lecturer Basim Fahad Abdullah, College of Agriculture, Tikrit University.
Assistant Professor Dr. Dawood Salman Madad, College of Agriculture, Tikrit University.
Assistant Professor Wisam Dawood Abdullah, College of Computer Science and Mathematics, Tikrit University.
This dataset consists of 55,450 rows and 13 columns, capturing essential agricultural parameters related to soybean plants. The dataset includes various features such as plant height, number of pods, biological weight, chlorophyll content, protein percentage, seed yield, and relative water content in leaves. These attributes are crucial for understanding the growth, productivity, and nutritional value of soybean crops under different environmental conditions.

A key feature of this dataset is the Parameters column, which encodes essential experimental conditions affecting soybean growth. The letters in the Parameters column represent the following:

G: Refers to the genotype of soybean, consisting of six different genotypes.
C: Represents salicylic acid, which has two levels (250 mg and 450 mg), along with a third level as a standard control.
S: Indicates water stress, which includes two levels:
Water stress at 5% of field capacity.
Water stress at 70% of field capacity.
The Advanced Soybean Agricultural Dataset is structured to facilitate diverse analytical and predictive modeling applications, particularly in precision agriculture, yield prediction, and crop health assessment. With its comprehensive set of features and randomized samples, this dataset is ideal for researchers, agronomists, and data scientists interested in agricultural optimization and decision-making.
